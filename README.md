🤖 An introduction to Neurosymbolic AI — the hybrid field combining neural networks' pattern learning with symbolic AI's structured reasoning.

Neurosymbolic AI combines the pattern-matching power of neural networks (deep learning) with the structure and explainability of symbolic AI (logic and rules). This hybrid approach aims to produce models that are more accurate, data-efficient, and easier to verify.

Below are four common ways to combine neural and symbolic components.

## Core approaches

### 1. Training with embedded constraints

Inject symbolic rules directly into the training objective so the model is penalized for violating known constraints in addition to prediction error.

Simple example — physics simulation:

- Neural part: a network predicts a ball's trajectory.
- Symbolic part: conservation of energy (Energy_initial == Energy_final).

How it works: the loss adds a constraint penalty. If predictions violate conservation laws, the penalty increases and the model learns physically plausible behavior.

### 2. Perception manipulated by logic

This follows a System 1 (fast perception) / System 2 (deliberative reasoning) design. A neural network provides perceptual outputs; a symbolic reasoner uses rules to act on those outputs.

Example — autonomous vehicle at a traffic light:

- Neural (perception): vision model → { sees: true, object: "Traffic Light", color: "Red" }
- Symbolic (planning): rule: IF object == "Traffic Light" AND color == "Red" THEN action = "Stop"

### 3. Logic-based output correction

The neural model generates an answer, which a symbolic layer validates or corrects post-hoc using a knowledge base or rule set.

Example — medical assistant chatbot:

- Neural: LLM answers, possibly with hallucinations.
- Symbolic: knowledge-base lookup and rule checking to confirm or correct the answer before returning it to the user.

This pattern reduces risky hallucinations and increases trustworthiness for safety-critical domains.

### 4. Neural optimization to learn symbolic knowledge

Use differentiable/neural optimization to induce symbolic rules from data (e.g., differentiable ILP, Neuro-Symbolic Concept Learner).

Example — learn FizzBuzz rules from examples instead of hard-coding them.

The system searches candidate symbolic rules and optimizes their weights/selection using gradient-based methods, producing human-readable rules that explain the data.

## Examples

Pseudo-code examples to illustrate the patterns above.

1) Training with embedded constraints — loss augmentation:

```python
# prediction_loss = cross_entropy(predictions, labels)
# constraint_violation = compute_energy_violation(predictions)
# loss = prediction_loss + lambda * constraint_violation
```

2) Perception + logic — simple pipeline:

```text
# perception -> {object: "Traffic Light", color: "Red"}
# rule: IF object == "Traffic Light" AND color == "Red" THEN Stop
```

3) Logic-based output correction — validation step:

```text
# neural_answer = model.predict(question)
# corrected = kb.validate_and_correct(neural_answer)
# return corrected
```

4) Neural optimization to learn symbolic knowledge — FizzBuzz style:

```prolog
output(X, "Fizz") :- divisible_by(X, 3).
output(X, "Buzz") :- divisible_by(X, 5).
```
